### Notes

- All changes to your bot's pricelist are applied atomically and will trigger a PM2 restart of your TF2Autobot process.
- The web interface reads/writes to `files/item_list.json` and your bot's `pricelist.json` as configured in `pricerConfig.json`.
- Outdated prices are detected using the `ageThresholdSec` setting.

## Features

- **ü§ñ Enhanced Multi-Bot Configuration:** Auto-discovery and management of multiple tf2autobot instances with visual web interface.
- **üîß Improved WebSocket Reliability:** Enhanced connection monitoring with automatic recovery from connection issues.
- **Automated Pricing:** Generates item prices using real-time and snapshot [backpack.tf](https://backpack.tf/) listing data, ensuring a profit margin and performing various sanity checks.
- **Robust Fallback Pricing:** If an item cannot be priced from listings, the pricer will attempt to fetch and convert Steam Community Market (SCM) prices (with configurable margin and rounding), and only fall back to Backpack.tf (BPTF) prices as a last resort. This fallback system supports all item types, including unusuals, killstreakers, and special attributes.
- **Baseline Comparison:** Compares generated prices against [Prices.tf](https://github.com/prices-tf) and disregards prices that exceed configured percentage thresholds.
- **Trusted/Blacklisted Steam IDs:** Prioritises listings from trusted bots and filters out untrusted bots when calculating prices. Fully configurable.
- **Excluded Listing Descriptions:** Filters out listings with descriptions containing configured keywords (e.g., spells).
- **Outlier Filtering:** Removes listings with prices that deviate too much from the average.
- **API Functionality:** Add/delete items for auto-pricing and retrieve prices via the API.
- **Socket.IO Server:** Emits item prices to listeners in a format compatible with [TF2 Auto Bot](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot).
- **Price Watcher Web Interface:** Dashboard to monitor item data freshness, view outdated entries, and manage your bot's selling pricelist.

---

## Pricing Logic & Fallback System

The pricer uses a robust multi-stage fallback system to ensure all items (including rare, unusual, and illiquid items) are priced as reliably as possible:

1. **Own Listings:** Attempt to price using live buy/sell listings from trusted sources.
2. **Steam Community Market (SCM) Fallback:** If not enough listings are available, the pricer fetches the item's SCM price, converts it to keys/metal (using the current key price), applies configurable margins (`scmMarginBuy`, `scmMarginSell`), and always rounds to the nearest scrap. This fallback is robust for all item types, including unusuals, killstreakers, australium, and special attributes.
3. **Backpack.tf (BPTF) Fallback:** If SCM pricing is unavailable, the pricer falls back to BPTF prices as a last resort.

- **Batching & Rate Limiting:** SCM fallback requests are batched and rate-limited using [`p-limit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p-limit) to avoid Steam rate limits and ensure stability, even with large numbers of unpriced items.
- **Rounding:** All fallback prices (SCM or BPTF) are always rounded to the nearest scrap for consistency.
- **Source:** All fallback prices use `source: 'bptf'` for compatibility with TF2Autobot and other bots.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v22.0.0 or newer - required for built-in fetch support)
- **npm**
- **PostgreSQL** (v12 or newer)
- **TF2 Auto Bot**

---

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OliverPerring/bliss-autopricer.git
cd bliss-autopricer
npm install
```

**üìã Included Files Check:**
The following required files should be present after cloning:
- ‚úÖ `config.json` - Main configuration file (needs your API keys)
- ‚úÖ `pricerConfig.json` - Bot configuration (auto-managed by setup)
- ‚úÖ `initialize-db.sql` - Database setup script
- ‚úÖ `setup-bots.js` - Auto-discovery setup script
- ‚úÖ `files/item_list.json` - Example item list
- ‚úÖ `files/pricelist.json` - Example pricelist
- ‚úÖ All required modules in `modules/` directory

**üì¶ Dependencies:**
- All required Node.js packages are listed in `package.json`
- `node-fetch` is included for compatibility (but uses built-in fetch when available)
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies automatically

If any files are missing, re-clone the repository.

### 2. Configure Application

**üöÄ NEW: Enhanced Bot Configuration System**

We've made bot setup **10x easier** with automatic discovery and multi-bot support!

#### Step 1: Configure API Keys and Database

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Before running the setup, you MUST configure your API keys and database connection in `config.json`. The autopricer will fail with a 403 error if you skip this step.

**üìù Required API Keys:**
1. **Backpack.tf API Key:** Get from [backpack.tf](https://backpack.tf/developer)
2. **Backpack.tf Token:** Get from [backpack.tf](https://backpack.tf/developer) 
3. **Steam API Key:** Get from [steamcommunity.com](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

Edit `config.json` and replace ALL placeholder values:

```json
{
  "bptfAPIKey": "your_actual_bptf_api_key_here",
  "bptfToken": "your_actual_bptf_token_here", 
  "steamAPIKey": "your_actual_steam_api_key_here",
  "database": {
    "schema": "tf2",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "name": "bptf-autopricer",
    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "your_actual_database_password"
  },
  // ... rest of configuration
}
```

**üö® Common Error:** If you get `ERR_BAD_REQUEST` with status 403, you haven't configured your API keys correctly.

**‚úÖ Validation Tool:** Run `npm run validate-config` to check if your configuration is correct before starting the autopricer.

#### Step 2: Quick Bot Setup (Recommended)

```sh
npm run setup
```

This command will:
- Automatically find your tf2autobot installations
- Discover all bot configurations
- Set up the configuration file for you
- Show you which bots were found
- Provide clear next steps

#### Alternative: Manual Configuration

If auto-discovery doesn't find your bots, you can:
1. Start the Price Watcher: `npm start`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/bot-config`
3. Add your bots manually through the web interface

#### Traditional Setup

You can still manually configure `pricerConfig.json` if preferred (see Configuration section below).
The new system handles this automatically.

**üìö For detailed information about the new bot configuration system, see:**
- **[Multi-Bot System Guide](MULTI-BOT-SYSTEM.md)** - Complete overview
- **[Bot Configuration Documentation](BOT-CONFIGURATION.md)** - Detailed setup guide

---

## PostgreSQL Setup

### 1. Install PostgreSQL

- Download and install from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- Ensure the PostgreSQL service is running.

### 2. Create Database and Schema

Open a terminal and run:

```sh
psql -U postgres
```

Then, in the psql prompt:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE "bptf-autopricer";
\c bptf-autopricer
CREATE SCHEMA tf2 AUTHORIZATION postgres;
```

### 3. Create Tables

You can use the provided [`initialize-db.sql`](initialize-db.sql):

```sh
psql -U postgres -d bptf-autopricer -f initialize-db.sql
```

Or run the following SQL manually:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tf2.listings (
  name character varying NOT NULL,
  sku character varying NOT NULL,
  currencies json NOT NULL,
  intent character varying NOT NULL,
  updated bigint NOT NULL,
  steamid character varying NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (name, sku, intent, steamid)
);

CREATE TABLE tf2.key_prices (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  sku TEXT NOT NULL,
  buy_price_metal DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  sell_price_metal DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  timestamp INT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE tf2.listing_stats (
  sku TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  current_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  moving_avg_count REAL DEFAULT 0,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW (),
  current_buy_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  moving_avg_buy_count real DEFAULT 0,
  current_sell_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  moving_avg_sell_count real DEFAULT 0
);
```

### 4. Test Database Connection and Permissions

In psql, run:

```sql
\dt tf2.*
```

You should see the three tables listed.  
Test permissions by inserting a test row (replace values as needed):

```sql
INSERT INTO
  tf2.listings (name, sku, currencies, intent, updated, steamid)
VALUES
  (
    'Test Item',
    '123;6',
    '{"keys":1,"metal":10}',
    'buy',
    1700000000,
    '12345678901234567'
  );
```

If you get no errors, your user has the correct permissions.

---

## Configuration

### `config.json`

Holds core pricer settings:

```json
{
  "bptfAPIKey": "<your backpack.tf API key>",
  "bptfToken": "<your backpack.tf token>",
  "steamAPIKey": "<your Steam API key>",
  "database": {
    "schema": "tf2",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "name": "bptf-autopricer",
    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "<db password>"
  },
  "pricerPort": 3456,
  "maxPercentageDifferences": {
    "buy": 5,
    "sell": -8
  },
  "alwaysQuerySnapshotAPI": true,
  "fallbackOntoPricesTf": false,
  "excludedSteamIDs": ["76561199384015307", "..."],
  "trustedSteamIDs": ["76561199110778355", "..."],
  "excludedListingDescriptions": ["exorcism", "spell", "spelled"],
  "blockedAttributes": {
    "Australium Gold": 15185211,
    "Team Spirit": 12073019,
    "..."
  },
  "scmMarginBuy": 0.05, // (optional) Margin to subtract from SCM price when buying (e.g., 0.05 = 5% below SCM)
  "scmMarginSell": 0.05 // (optional) Margin to add to SCM price when selling (e.g., 0.05 = 5% above SCM)
}
```

- `scmMarginBuy` and `scmMarginSell` control the buy/sell margins applied to fallback SCM prices. If omitted, margins default to 0 (no adjustment).
- All fallback prices are always rounded to the nearest scrap for consistency.
- See the [Pricing Logic & Fallback System](#pricing-logic--fallback-system) section for details.

### `pricerConfig.json` - Bot Configuration

## API Routes & Socket.IO

The Socket.IO server emits events called `price` with an item object as the value.  
The item objects are structured as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "Strange Australium Minigun",
  "sku": "202;11;australium",
  "source": "bptf",
  "time": 1700403492,
  "buy": { "keys": 25, "metal": 21.33 },
  "sell": { "keys": 26, "metal": 61.77 }
}
```

This format is compatible with [TF2 Auto Bot](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot) custom pricer interface.

### Example API Endpoints

- `GET /items/:sku` ‚Äî Retrieve a particular item object from the pricelist.
- `GET /items/` ‚Äî Retrieve the entire pricelist.
- `POST /items/:sku` ‚Äî Endpoint for integration with TF2 Auto Bot.
- `POST /items/add/:name` ‚Äî Add an item to be auto-priced.
- `POST /items/delete/:name` ‚Äî Remove an item from auto-pricing.

See the full API documentation in this README for request/response details.

## FAQ

- **üö® I'm getting 'ERR_BAD_REQUEST' with status code 403 when starting the autopricer. What's wrong?**  
  This error means your API keys are not configured correctly in `config.json`. Make sure you have:
  - Replaced `"your bptf api key"` with your actual backpack.tf API key
  - Replaced `"your bptf token"` with your actual backpack.tf token  
  - Replaced `"your steam api key"` with your actual Steam API key
  - Set up your database credentials correctly
  
  Get your API keys from [backpack.tf/developer](https://backpack.tf/developer) and [steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

- **ü§ñ How do I set up multiple bots or switch between bot configurations?**  
  Use the new multi-bot system! Run `npm run setup` to auto-discover your bots, or visit `http://localhost:3000/bot-config` to manage them manually. See the [Multi-Bot System Guide](MULTI-BOT-SYSTEM.md) for details.

- **üîß The autopricer stopped receiving price updates from backpack.tf. What's wrong?**  
  This has been fixed! The enhanced websocket monitoring system now automatically detects and recovers from connection issues. Check `http://localhost:3456/websocket-status` for real-time connection health.

- **üìÅ I'm having trouble configuring the tf2autobot directory paths.**  
  You no longer need to configure paths manually! The auto-discovery system finds your tf2autobot installations automatically. Run `npm run setup` or use the web interface at `/bot-config`.

- **How do I connect this to TF2AutoBot?**  
  See: [jack-richards#11](https://github.com/jack-richards/bptf-autopricer/issues/11)

- **I am getting a 429 error in the console, what does this mean?**  
  See: [jack-richards#17](https://github.com/jack-richards/bptf-autopricer/issues/17)

- **I am being shown 'error: relation "listings" does not exist' when running the pricer.**  
  See: [jack-richards#14](https://github.com/jack-richards/bptf-autopricer/issues/14)

- **Why is the pricer giving a 'Not valid JSON error'?**  
  Your JSON isn't valid‚Äîcheck that `item_list.json` matches [this example](https://github.com/jack-richards/bptf-autopricer/blob/main/files/item_list.json).

- **There are loads of 'Couldn't price item' errors, is everything broken?!**  
  No! The pricer is protecting you by discarding prices that deviate too much from the baseline. Over time, most items will be priced and updated regularly.
